// As seen in the previous exercise, the time of day can be represented as the
// number of minutes before or after midnight. If the number of minutes is
// positive, the time is after midnight. If the number of minutes is negative,
// the time is before midnight.

// Write two functions that each take a time of day in 24 hour format, and
// return the number of minutes before and after midnight, respectively. Both
// functions should return a value in the range 0..1439.

// You may not use javascript's Date class methods.
